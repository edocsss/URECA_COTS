COTS (Context-based Operational Transformation Space) Diagram Generator
=================================================================================

URECA or Undergraduate Research Experience on CAmpus is a programme offered by Nanyang Technological University with the aim of giving undergraduate students the experience of doing a research on a particular subject.

The research I chose is making a software which will generate a COTS diagram based on the given expression. I am under Prof. Sun Chengzheng supervision.

This software will be used by researchers so that they do not have to manually draw the COTS diagram given an expression.
